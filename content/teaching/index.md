## Past University Teaching

### UPenn

Courses taught as a Hans Rademacher Instructor (postdoc):

- 1300: Introduction to Calculus
- 1400: Calculus I
- 4100: Complex Analysis

### UCLA

I was a teaching assistant for the following math classes at UCLA:

- 114L: Mathematical Logic

## Outreach

### Olga Radko Math Circle

Most Sundays during my time at UCLA, I taught high school students at the [Olga Radko Math Circle](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~radko/circles/), which I also attended in middle and high school. Here are some of the lessons I wrote:

- Electrical circuits and random walks [[pdf 1](ormc/EERandomWalks.pdf)] [[pdf 2](ormc/EERandomWalks2.pdf)]
- The Cantor Set [[pdf 1](ormc/CantorSet.pdf)][[pdf 2](ormc/CantorSet2.pdf)]
- Triangulated polygons and frieze patterns [[pdf 1](ormc/tpfp1.pdf)] [[pdf 2](ormc/tpfp2.pdf)]
- Generating Functions [[pdf](ormc/generatingfunctions.pdf)]
- Graph Theory, Sperner's Lemma, Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem [[pdf 1](ormc/SpernerBrouwer.pdf)] [[pdf 2](ormc/SpernerBrouwer2.pdf)]
- Game Theory [[pdf](ormc/gametheory.pdf)]
- Cryptography [[pdf](ormc/crypto.pdf)]
- Dynamical Systems (mostly on the Logistic map and the Mandelbrot set) [[pdf](ormc/dynamics.pdf)]

### Canada/USA Mathcamp

I have taught for several summers at [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://mathcamp.org), which I also attended in high school. Here are problems and notes for some of the classes I taught:

- Incidence Combinatorics [[problems](mathcamp/incidence_combinatorics.pdf)]
- Model Theory [[notes](mathcamp/model_theory.pdf)]
- Surreal Numbers [[problems](mathcamp/surreal_numbers.pdf)] [[impartial games](mathcamp/Impartial%20Games.pdf)] [[partizan games](mathcamp/Partizan%20Games.pdf)]
- Sperner's Lemma and Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem [[problems](mathcamp/spernerbrouwer.pdf)]
- Theorem Proving in Lean (cowritten with [Apurva Nakade](https://apurvanakade.github.io/) and [Jalex Stark](https://www.jalexstark.com/))[[link](https://awainverse.github.io/mc2022-Lean/)]
- VC-Dimension [[notes](mathcamp/vc.pdf)]
