### Topics

We will cover a variety of topics in model theory, highlighting connections to combina-
torics and algebra. We will start with an exploration of quantiﬁer elimination in a number of
classic theories. We will then dive deeper into the model theory of real closed ﬁelds (such as $\mathbb{R}$)
in particular, generalizing to o-minimal structures, covering properties such as o-minimal cell decomposition.
There are then several topics which we can pursue, depending on time and interest, such as
- Pregeometries/matroids/dimension in strongly minimal and o-minimal structures
- Semialgebraic incidence combinatorics and distal cell decompositions
- NIP, VC-dimension and connections with statistical learning theory

### Sources and Books

I will be using a variety of sources for this class, so the authoritative source for lecture materials will be my lecture notes, posted on this site.
For the first part of the class, my main source will be [Marker](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b98860), which should be available at that link through Penn.
I may assign some homework problems from Marker - if you have trouble accessing it, email me.

Here is a larger list of books/notes that may be useful:
- [Marker. Model Theory: An Introduction.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b98860)
- [Tent, Ziegler. A Course in Model Theory.](https://find.library.upenn.edu/catalog/9979240162503681?hld_id=53790653780003681)
- [van den Dries. Tame topology and o-minimal structures.](https://find.library.upenn.edu/catalog/9979239040403681?hld_id=53789780650003681)

### Grading

Students will be graded either on presentations or homework.
Undergraduate students should enroll in LGIC 3200 or PHIL 4722 to be graded on homework,
while graduate students should enroll in MATH 5710 or PHIL 6722 to be graded on presentations.
