## Current Teaching

This fall, I am teaching Math 1400 and Math 4100 at UPenn. The online presence of each class is on Canvas.

- For information about 1400, see [here.](https://www.math.upenn.edu/undergraduate/courses/calculus-penn)
- For information about 4100, [download the syllabus.](penn/f25_4100/syllabus.pdf)

## Past University Teaching

### UPenn

Courses taught as a Hans Rademacher Instructor (postdoc):

- 1300: Introduction to Calculus
- 1400: Calculus I
- 4100: Complex Analysis

### UCLA

I was a teaching assistant for the following math classes at UCLA:

- 114L: Mathematical Logic
- 180: Graph Theory
- 170: Probability
- 106: History of Math
- 33A: Linear Algebra
- 61: Discrete Math

In 2019, I assisted at the [Curtis Center](https://curtiscenter.math.ucla.edu/).

### Caltech

At Caltech, I was a teaching assistant for Ma6a: Discrete Math.

## Outreach

### Canada/USA Mathcamp

I have taught for several summers at [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://mathcamp.org), which I also attended in high school.
Here are problems and notes for some of the classes I taught:

- Incidence Combinatorics [[problems](mathcamp/incidence_combinatorics.pdf)]
- Model Theory [[notes](mathcamp/model_theory.pdf)]
- Surreal Numbers [[problems](mathcamp/surreal_numbers.pdf)] [[impartial games](mathcamp/Impartial%20Games.pdf)] [[partizan games](mathcamp/Partizan%20Games.pdf)]
- Sperner's Lemma and Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem [[problems](mathcamp/spernerbrouwer.pdf)]
- Theorem Proving in Lean (cowritten with [Apurva Nakade](https://apurvanakade.github.io/) and [Jalex Stark](https://www.jalexstark.com/))[[link](https://awainverse.github.io/mc2022-Lean/)]
- VC-Dimension [[notes](mathcamp/vc.pdf)]

Email me for solutions.

### Olga Radko Math Circle

Most Sundays during my time at UCLA, I taught high school students at the [Olga Radko Math Circle](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~radko/circles/), which I also attended in middle and high school. Here are some of the lessons I wrote:

- Electrical circuits and random walks [[pdf 1](ormc/EERandomWalks.pdf)] [[pdf 2](ormc/EERandomWalks2.pdf)]
- The Cantor Set [[pdf 1](ormc/CantorSet.pdf)][[pdf 2](ormc/CantorSet2.pdf)]
- Triangulated polygons and frieze patterns [[pdf 1](ormc/tpfp1.pdf)] [[pdf 2](ormc/tpfp2.pdf)]
- Generating Functions [[pdf](ormc/generatingfunctions.pdf)]
- Graph Theory, Sperner's Lemma, Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem [[pdf 1](ormc/SpernerBrouwer.pdf)] [[pdf 2](ormc/SpernerBrouwer2.pdf)]
- Game Theory [[pdf](ormc/gametheory.pdf)]
- Cryptography [[pdf](ormc/crypto.pdf)]
- Dynamical Systems (mostly on the Logistic map and the Mandelbrot set) [[pdf](ormc/dynamics.pdf)]

## Advising

I have advised a number of students through mathematics formalization projects in Lean.
These include a Directed Reading Project with Norman Chen at UCLA, and a number of students at Canada/USA Mathcamp.
Two of these projects that ended up pushing code to mathlib include [Gabin Kolly's master's thesis](https://florisvandoorn.com/theses/GabinKolly.pdf)
and
[this Mathcamp project by Alex Zhao](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/NumberTheory/FrobeniusNumber.html).
