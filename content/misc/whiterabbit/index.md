A sketch of the proofs of the upward and downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorems, set to the tune of White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane.

One way makes it larger  
and the other makes it small  
If you want to find a model  
Of any size at all  
Go ask [L-S](https://james-hanson.github.io/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim-Skolem_Theorem.html)  
[Leopold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_L%C3%B6wenheim) and [Thoralf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoralf_Skolem)

If you have two nested structures  
Then to show that they agree  
[On each first-order question](https://james-hanson.github.io/wiki/Elementary_extension.html)  
You could ask conceivably  
[Just find a witness](https://james-hanson.github.io/wiki/Elementary_extension#The_Tarski-Vaught_Criterion)  
For every backwards $\exists$ 

To make this happen, [add a function](https://james-hanson.github.io/wiki/Skolem_functions.html)  
For every existential  
If there's a witness, just point to one  
If not, then return null  
There's a substructure  
Of size $\omega$ plus $\mathcal{L}$

If logic and proportion  
Have fallen to their knees  
When we add some distinct constants  
[and every sentence about these](https://james-hanson.github.io/wiki/Diagram)  
The contradiction was with us already
