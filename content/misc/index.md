- I am a contributor to [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/), the main repository of math formalized in the Lean theorem prover. My contributions are visible on [github](https://github.com/awainverse).
- In summers 2011-2014, I attended [Canada/USA Mathcamp](https://www.mathcamp.org/). I recommend it most strongly for high-schoolers interested in math.
- As an undergrad, I helped organize the [Caltech Harvey Mudd Math Competition](http://chmmc.caltech.edu/), a one-day, on-site math competition for high school students.
- Dabney Pumpkin Drop: Every Halloween, residents of Caltech's Dabney Hovse freeze pumpkins in liquid nitrogen and drop them off the tallest building on campus, Millikan Library. I was one of the pumpkin-droppers for several years, and was interviewed for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGKYOG98j7M).
- I wrote [lyrics](whiterabbit) for the tune of White Rabbit by Jefferson Airplane, sketching the proof of LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem.
