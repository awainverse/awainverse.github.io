##### Abstract:

We identify several examples of distal metric structures and examine several consequences of distality, such as the existence of distal cell decompositions, in each. These results include joint work with Itaï Ben Yaacov and with Diego Bejarano.

One class of examples starts with finding a metric structure whose automorphism group is the group of increasing homeomorphisms of the unit interval. We will discuss some properties of this structure and extrapolate to other models of its theory, which we call “dual linear continua.”

Another source of examples includes real closed metric valued fields. These give rise to a notion of ordered metric structure, providing a viewpoint to study o-minimality in continuous logic.
