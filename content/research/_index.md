# Research

I'm interested in model theory as it relates to combinatorics and other fields.
So far, my research has primarily been about [distal structures]("http://forkinganddividing.com/#_00_16"),
including $o$-minimal structures and the $p$-adics.
I've worked on combinatorial applications of distality, and on studying distal metric structures in continuous logic.
