I'm interested in model theory as it relates to combinatorics and other fields.

My research has primarily been about [distal structures]("http://forkinganddividing.com/#_00_16"), including $o$-minimal structures and the $p$-adics.
I've worked on combinatorial applications of distality, and on studying distal metric structures in continuous logic.

See my papers below or on the [arXiv]("https://arxiv.org/a/anderson_a_3.html").
