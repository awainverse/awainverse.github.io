##### Abstract

We realize the $\mathbb{F}_q$-algebra $M(\mathbb{F}_q)$ studied by von
Neumann and Halperin as the Fraïssé limit of the class of
finite-dimensional matrix algebras over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$
equipped with the rank metric. We then provide a new Fraïssé-theoretic
proof of uniqueness of such an object. Using the results of Carderi and
Thom, we show that the automorphism group of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_q )$
is extremely amenable. We deduce a Ramsey-theoretic property for the class
of algebras $M(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and provide an explicit bound for the
quantities involved.
